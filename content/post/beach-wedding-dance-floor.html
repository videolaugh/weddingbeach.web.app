        <p>For this beach wedding in montauk, new york, each attendant got to choose their own bridesmaid dress. Using firm tiles as a base layer will create a floor that’s appropriate for almost any kind of dancing at the reception. Rental dance floors come in a range of materials (like wood and sheet vinyl) and a variety of colors.</p>

        <p>Find a couple customer service. I’d think you’d be hard pressed to find a place that will rent you a dance floor to sit on the beach (the dance floor for my outdoor wedding came with explicit instructions that it needed to be under the tent/shelter the whole time!), but if you want dancing, a surface that’s easier on the feet than sand is key.</p>

        <p>A soft wedding color, like blush, is a great choice for a beach wedding because it so effortlessly complements the hues seen along the shore. A sturdy base allows the outdoor wedding dance floor to go over almost any type of ground, including grass, dirt, sand, or gravel, creating a firm area that’s safe for dancing.</p>
