        <p>With beautiful white sands and a campsite for all your guests you can turn your wedding into an exciting weekend away. On top of all of this, they can even distil a special gin as a lovely memento (if you can stop yourself drinking it all on the day, of course). I specialise in photographing weddings and elopements on the scottish islands.</p>
