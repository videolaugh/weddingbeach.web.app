        <h3>Unfortunately, The Answer Is No.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Church rates these days are really really costly! In a time when many catholic couples are opting for destination weddings, and few parishes able to assist them, the catholic church of the holy spirit has the perfect solution! The beach is a public space governed by county rules.</p>
        <h3>Many Modern Couples, Who Want To Keep These Traditions, Have Wondered If They Can Organize This Special Event Outside The Church.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A few advantages of a destination wedding for catholics: By the way, you can’t have 2 ceremonies for the same marriage so that wouldn’t have worked. However, you might consider having a marriage blessing on the beach, or anywhere else for that matter, performed by a priest.</p>
        <h3>You Can Also Get Married By The Beach As Long As Its In A Chapel By The Beach.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Is there any way at all that we can have a recognized catholic wedding on the beach? But the following paragraph may at first glance give tim’s daughter a glimmer of hope: Hello everybody, we would like to have a catholic beach wedding.</p>
        <h3>A Priest Recently Explained Why.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I understand that, especially in the us, the catholic church does not support that idea. You may point out that las vegas wedding chapels fill this requirement. I don’t mind it but some people do.</p>
        <h3>You Would Also Have To Promise To Raise Your Kids As Catholics.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If it is an emergency or wants to have the wedding at the place of your dreams (a beach, for instance). Unfortunately, your parents don’t seem interested in a compromise. If you’re a catholic, forget about having a beach or garden wedding.</p>
